# Unitarity Tests
- + Probability conservation maintained in semi-classical waveforms
- + Correlator positivity preserved in strong-curvature regime
- + Trace preservation verified in density matrix evolution

# Gauge Invariance Tests 
- + Observables invariant under diffeomorphism transformations
- + Physical quantities independent of coordinate choice
- + Gauge parameter variation preserves observables within tolerance

# Classical Limit Recovery
- + Schwarzschild metric recovered as h->0
- + Quantum corrections scale with appropriate powers of h
- + Waveform amplitudes reduce to classical GR predictions

# Conclusion
The theoretical framework demonstrates full consistency with fundamental principles:
- Unitarity is maintained, ensuring probability conservation
- Gauge invariance holds, confirming physical observables are properly defined
- Classical GR is recovered in the appropriate limit

These results validate that the warp sensitivity analysis satisfies all required consistency checks
and the quantum gravity corrections preserve the expected theoretical properties.
